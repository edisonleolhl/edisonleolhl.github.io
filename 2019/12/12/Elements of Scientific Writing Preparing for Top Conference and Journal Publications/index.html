<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Scientific writing for both conferences and journals is essential for research-based graduate students. In the current practice, a starting young researcher often learns how to write a scientific paper by mimicking authors of published papers, which can be misleading. His supervisor then laboriously, and perhaps even painfully, corrects the first manuscript draft. Both parties can end up with extreme frustration. Despite the importance of scientific writing, few universities have such a formal course that is specially designed for top conference and journal publications. The purpose of this course is to fill this gap. In this short course (16 lecture hours), assuming that the students have intermediate-level of English language skills, we will cover the following elements of writing a scientific paper: essential units of a research paper and how to write abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion; common English usage mistakes to avoid; effective writing principles; how to construct strong proses; how to write correct mathematical expressions and illustrate scientific results. We will also cover important topics such as how to communicate with the editors, as well as ethics associated with research publications.</p>
<h2 id="Instructor’s-biography"><a href="#Instructor’s-biography" class="headerlink" title="Instructor’s biography"></a>Instructor’s biography</h2><p>Julian Cheng received his B. Eng. degree in electrical engineering from University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada, M.Sc. (Eng.) degree in Mathematics and Engineering from Queen’s University, Kingston, ON, Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada. He is currently a Full Professor in the School of Engineering, Faculty of Applied Science, at The University of British Columbia (Okanagan campus) in Kelowna, BC, Canada. His current research interests include wireless communication theory, wireless networks, optical wireless communications, wireless locations, and quantum communications. Dr. Cheng has successfully trained a large number of graduate students on how to write high quality research articles, and many of these students are international students with little prior knowledge on scientific writing. He has co-authored more than 270 journals and conference publications, and vast majority of these publications have appeared in top venues. He now serves as an Area Editor for IEEE Transactions on Communications. In the past, he served as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Communications Letters, and IEEE Access, and was a past Guest Editor for a special issue of IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications on optical wireless communications. Currently, he serves as the head of the electrical engineering program in the School of Engineering at UBC as well as the President of the Canadian Society of Information Theory.</p>

<li>Titile<ul>
<li>Title should be concise and define the scope of the paper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abstract<ul>
<li>Abstract contains a summary of the paper, a brief description of the problem, the solution, and conclusions. Be concise, e.g., TCOM allows Abstract with only 200 words. Avoid reference citation and abbreviations.</li>
<li>How to write an Abstract? Draft your Abstract by picking out major objective&#x2F;hypotheses and conclusions from your Introduction and Conclusion sections, select key sentences and phrases from your Method section, reveal your finding from your Results section. Link your sentences and form them into a single paragraph and re-write. Good writing is all about re-writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keywords<ul>
<li>IEEE papers typically require five keywords listed in alphabetical order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduction<ul>
<li>Don’t underestimate the importance of Introduction. </li>
<li>A good introduction tells a good story and cite the related papers in the course of doing so. </li>
<li>Provide motivations of the entire paper. Review and cite all relevant papers. </li>
<li>Provide a brief description of the research problem to be addressed and the proposed solutions. </li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Methodology and Solutions<ul>
<li>Core part of the paper and should be worked out before you start writing any paper. Foundation of the entire paper. </li>
<li>New results are not the grounds for publications. </li>
<li>Writing is not about communicating to the reader about your idea. It is about changing their ideas. </li>
<li>Tip: Work out special cases and link your special results to the ones that have already been published. </li>
<li>A paper with <strong>novelty</strong> is likely to be well received. You want to give the reviewers an Aha moment. </li>
<li>A paper with elegant and useful analytical results is always worth publishing. </li>
<li>A paper that is correct and explains a counter-intuitive phenomenon is always worth publishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numerical Results &amp; Discussions<ul>
<li>For certain analytical results, it is always good idea to verify using Monte Carlo computer simulations. </li>
<li>The parameter values should be taken, whenever possible, from systems in the real world. </li>
<li>All numerical should be interpreted. You need to explain why curves look the way they do. </li>
<li>It is generally good idea to compare your numerical results with the ones from a comparable system in existing literature. </li>
<li>Tip: Font size for the figures should be sufficiently large so that they are still readable after being scaled down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusions <ul>
<li>Conclusions summarize the work and highlight the most significant findings. This is also where the future work should be discussed.</li>

<p>What is the difference between research and plagiarism? </p>
<p>➢The act is considered to be plagiarism if you use one source for your point of view within your research paper. </p>
<p>➢But it is considered research if you use more than one source to cover the topic. </p>
<p>Types of plagiarism with severity levels </p>
<p>➢Paraphrasing plagiarism (Severe) </p>
<p>➢Verbatim plagiarism (Serious) </p>
<p>➢Global plagiarism (Severe) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Using other’s work and claiming your work, including paying for essays or papers. </p>
<p>➢Many these “customized papers” are plagiarised and have poor quality. </p>
<p>➢If caught, the student can either fail the course or get expelled by his&#x2F;her university. </p>
<p>➢Universities can also revoke degrees. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>➢Self-plagiarism ( Moderate) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This policy is found in the IEEE Policies document, Sections 6.4.1B(f) and 6.4.1B(h). These two sections are given below. </p>
<p>(f) Plagiarism is unacceptable. The verbatim copying or reuse of one’s own research) as indicated in paragraph “h” below) is considered another form of plagiarism or self- plagiarism; it is unacceptable. </p>
<p>(h) Except as indicated in Section 6.3.4 (Multiple Publication of Original Technical Material in IEEE Periodicals), authors should only submit original work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication, nor which is under review for another refereed publication. If authors have used their own previously published work(s) as a basis for a new submission, they are required to cite the previous work(s) and very briefly indicate how the new submission offers substantial novel contributions beyond those of the previously published work(s). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>➢Incorrect citation (Moderate) </p>
<p>➢Non-existent source (Severe) </p>

<p>➢IEEE Communications Letters &#x2F;IEEE Wireless Communications Letters: <strong>No</strong> </p>
<p>➢IEEE Transactions on Communications or IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications: <strong>Yes</strong>, but the authors must cite the conference version and state the novelties and contributions beyond the conference papers. </p>
<p>➢ IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems: Yes, but <strong>50%</strong> additional technical material is expected. </p>
<h3 id="What-is-double-submission-一稿多投"><a href="#What-is-double-submission-一稿多投" class="headerlink" title="What is double submission? 一稿多投"></a>What is double submission? 一稿多投</h3><p>Concurrent submission of the same paper to different journals </p>
<p>➢Two different papers but with large overlaps can also be considered as double submission! </p>
<p>➢Double submission can occur without being self- aware. </p>
<p>➢Always withdraw form one journal first before submitting to another journal. </p>
<p>➢If not sure, consult a trusted senior colleague. </p>
<p>How to avoid plagiarism? </p>
<p>➢Present your original ideas in an original way.<br>➢Always cite all related works and give credits to others. ➢Learn how to document quotation and cite properly. ➢Always cite your own related work. </p>
<p>➢Use a plagiarism checker software: WriteCheck (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.writecheck.com/)and">http://en.writecheck.com/)and</a> Turnitin (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.turnitin.com/">www.turnitin.com</a>) </p>
<p>Other forms of author misconduct </p>
<p>➢Submitting a paper without the permission of all co-authors </p>
<p>➢Providing incorrect email addresses of co-authors </p>
<p>➢Extra authors in the final paper submission </p>
<p>➢Reduce the number of pages in the camera-ready version to avoid overlength charge </p>
<p>➢Adding&#x2F;removing references from the camera-ready version </p>

<p>We have fixed the comma splice by using semicolon instead of comma. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>➢Jammal wanted to go to the ball game, but his friend Jason wanted to see the new movie. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We fix the comma splice by using a conjunction word (for and, nor, but, or, yet, so) , also known as <strong>FANBOYS</strong>, after the comma. </p>

<p>➢Reference [10] is concerned about … </p>
<p><strong>Use “Denote” correctly</strong> </p>
<p>➢The color red is used to denote passion or danger.</p>

<p><del>➢We denote N as the set of natural numbers.</del></p>
<p>➢We denote the set of natural numbers by N. </p>
<p><strong>“Minimum” or “Minimal”?</strong> </p>
<p>Minimum: smallest, least </p>
<p>Minimal: small amount of </p>
<p>➢The minimum bet for this Blackjack table is $10. </p>
<p>➢The function attains its minimum (value) when x&#x3D;0. </p>
<p>➢There is a minimal risk to invest in IBM stock. </p>
<p>➢When the housing market crashes, you can buy this house at minimal cost. </p>
<p>Remarks:<br> In math, “minimal value” means “local minimum”. </p>
<p>Similarly, maximum means largest, and maximal means large amount of. </p>
<p>Minima is the plural of minimum, and maxima is the plural of maximum. </p>
<p><strong>“Electric” vs. “Electrical” vs. “Electronic”</strong> </p>
<p>“Electric” refers to devices that run on electricity or produces electricity, and it can be used figuratively. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is acceptable to say an electric kettle or an electric tooth brush or electric cars, or the atmosphere is electric. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Electrical” is concerned with electricity. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is acceptable to say electrical engineers, electrical engineering. Normally we don’t say electric engineer or electric engineering. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Electronic” describes the devices with internal electrical components that manipulate electrical currents; It also refers to virtual form of things that exist in the traditional world </p>
<blockquote>
<p>electronic circuit board, electronic textbook, electronic file </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>“Relationship” or “Relation”?</strong></p>
<p>The word “relation” is used in formal writing, and it is used to describe the connection between large group of people, like countries, companies, shareholders, etc. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples are diplomatic relations, industrial relations, public relations, and race relations.</p>
<p>➢A company needs to improve its relations with its shareholders. </p>
<p>➢He does not want to endanger US trade and other relations with China. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Relation” sometimes means extended family member.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢I am going to visit my friends and relations.<br> ➢James Thompson was in court today accusing Cindy Thompson, no relation, of stealing his rabbit.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use “relation” to describe how two things are connected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢An inverse relation between wind speed and density fluctuations appears to exist. </p>
<p>➢This observation led us to hypothesize that there may exist a relation between the structural properties of the antenna array and the capacity of the channel. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use &#96;&#96;relationship” to describe the connection between smaller groups of people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢He had very strong relationships with elected officials. </p>
<p>➢We have strong relationships with our European suppliers. </p>
<p>➢But perhaps most importantly, a mother and daughter relationship is permanent. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use &#96;&#96;relationship” to describe a situation with a (romantic) partner. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢She was in a relationship with the Governor of California. ➢There were strong relationships in her life, but no marriages. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use relationship to describe how two things are connected. In this case, you can say &#96;&#96;relationship between … and …”or relationship between two …” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢The mechanism implied in this relationship between the two processes may be, at least in this study, an explanation for the general finding that the tropopause is a transport barrier. </p>
<p>➢There exists a relationship between the storm’s intensity and genesis location in the different phases of ENSO along with turbulent sea surface temperatures in the Northwest Pacific Ocean </p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Conclusion: In scientific writing, you can use either “relation” or “relationship” interchangeably to describe how two things are connected. But for the other</u><br><u>situations, relation cannot be replaced with &#96;&#96;relationship” and visa versa.</u></p>

<ul>
<li>It is a common mistake to set these in italic type</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Bracketing multilayered expressions</p>
<ul>
<li>have a choice of brackets for the layers as well as sizes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Write “the 𝑘th term”, not “the 𝑘^th term”, “the 𝑘’th term” or “the 𝑘-th term”</p>
</li>
<li><p>A slashed exponent, as in 𝑦1&#x2F;2, is generally preferable to a s </p>
<p>1 tacked one, as in fraction style</p>
</li>
<li><p>The standard way to express that 𝑖 is to take the values 1 to 𝑛 in steps of 1 is to write </p>

<h2 id="Lecture-12-Figures-and-Tables"><a href="#Lecture-12-Figures-and-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Lecture 12: Figures and Tables"></a>Lecture 12: Figures and Tables</h2><p>In academic works, visual contents matter! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Objective of an academic work is to disseminate the scholarly findings to the readership of a wide spectrum. </p>
<p>➢Readership often determines the worthiness of an academic work by observing the visual evidence. </p>
<p>➢ Use Meaningful Presentation with Few Possible Illustrations of Strong Impact </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is Meaningful Presentation? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Each figure and table should able to tell a story or meaningful research outcome without going through another illustration. </p>
<p>➢The story of a figure and table should be understood immediately by making a quick observation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>De-facto Rules of Meaningful Presentation </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Figures and tables should be consistent with the description of the text. </p>
<p>➢Legends of the figures and titles of the tables need to stand on their own. </p>
<p>➢Figures and tables need to be numbered in a same order they appear in the text. </p>
<p>Placement of Illustrations: Where and How? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Important rule: Place the figure and table in the place where it is expected. </p>
<p>➢Always keep the readership in mind to select a certain type of illustration. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure or Table: How to Select Appropriate Form of Presentation? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Use figure when pattern is important. </p>
<p>➢Use table when the actual value matters. </p>
<p>➢Use textual description when more precise description is required to compare a few data points. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Number of Illustrations vs. Impact of the Illustrations </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Keep the illustrations simple and few as much as possible to tell <strong>one complete story.</strong> </p>
<p>➢Also Measure the impact of the illustrations. ✓Avoid figures of repeated observation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Producing Professional Figures: Options </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Microsoft Excel can convert experimental data and export to several professional graphic software. </p>
<p>➢Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, ChemDraw, Microsoft Visio can be used for preparing system model&#x2F;block diagram. </p>
<p>Important Notes on Professional Figures </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Lines should have good contrast against a white background. </p>
<p>➢Axes, curves, and lettering must be solid and smooth. </p>
<p>➢All the components should be appropriately labeled. </p>
<p>➢Cluttering needs to be avoided. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>不要仅用颜色区分线条，黑白打印版看不出来区别</strong></p>
<p>Producing Professional Figures for Final Submission </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢It is good idea to draft&#x2F;prepare figures at an early stage. </p>
<p>➢Most of the IEEE Journals prefer figures either in <em>EPS</em> or <em>TIFF</em> format. </p>
<p>➢Prepare the figures according to the recommended formats. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarity and Integrity for Producing Figures </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢The presented data in a figure can sometimes be exaggerated or misleading. </p>
<p>➢Care needs to be taken to make the figures as accurate as possible to illustrate the <em>actual facts.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to Avoid Misleading Figures </p>
<p>➢Provide the relevant information of each figure to make it reproducible. </p>
<ol>
<li>a)  The exact parameters used in the experiment. </li>
<li>b)  The number of observations or sample size. </li>
<li>c)  Any other statistical information.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to Avoid Misleading of Figures (Cont’d) </p>
<p>➢Be aware about the limitation(s) of the data presented in a figure. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>a)  State all the necessary assumptions. </p>
</li>
<li><p>b)  When comparing two or more sets of data, </p>
<p>please state that under what condition such a comparison is valid.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Types of Figures </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢The figures presented in an academic work can be either <strong>photograph, drawing and diagram, and graphs</strong>. </p>
<p>➢The selection of specific type of figure depends on the objective. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guidelines of Using Photographs in the Scholarly Works </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Purpose: To illustrate the realism of the observed data in an experiment or an experimental system setup. </p>
<p>➢Key rule: Always aim to make photographic images as informative as possible. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Important Instructions for Photographs </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Label everything that is relevant. </p>
<p>➢Use scale bars in the micrographs. </p>
<p>➢If a record is not a obvious in the image, draw a separate diagram to emphasize the presence of such a record. </p>
<p>➢Check whether color photograph is acceptable by the intended venue of publication. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Purpose of Block Diagram </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Block diagrams are particularly important in the engineering academic papers. </p>
<p>➢Objective: </p>
<p>➢To illustrate how certain things, such as electrical, mechanical, or chemical objects, react with each other. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guidelines of Block Diagram </p>
<ol>
<li>a)  Keep the number of blocks small. </li>
<li>b)  Use consistent and meaningful name for each block. </li>
<li>c)  Use arrows to indicate the direction. </li>
<li>d)  Follow the same direction showed in the diagram in the textual description. </li>
<li>e)  Do not make the block diagram crowded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines for Graphs </p>
<p>✓Type of common graphs in an academic paper </p>
<ol>
<li>a)  Line graph. </li>
<li>b)  Scatter plot. </li>
<li>c)  Bar graph and Pier chart </li>
<li>d)  Box plot.</li>
</ol>
<p>✓It is important to know how to present data by an appropriate graph. </p>
<p><strong>Line Graph: Purpose</strong> </p>
<p>➢Most popular type of graphs in the scientific papers. </p>
<p>​	✓It is Primarily used to make comparisons, often over time. </p>
<p>​	✓Example: How the capacity of a wireless communication channel varies with respect to the transmission power. </p>
<p><strong>Line Graph: Guidelines</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Three or four curves should be maximum in a line graph. </p>
<p>➢Individual curves need to recognized properly, especially when they cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scatter Plot: Purpose and Generation </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Purpose: Find correlation between two sets of data obtained from an experiment. </p>
<p>➢MATLAB function, such as, <em>scatter, scatter3,</em> are useful to produce scattered plots. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bar Graph: Purpose and Generation </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Purpose of bar graph: </p>
<p>➢Compare the findings for different instances of an experiment when there is no continuity among the findings. </p>
<p>➢Use Vertical bars of same width in a bar graph. ➢MATLAB function, such as, <em>bar, bar3,</em> are useful to produce bar graph. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Box Plot: Purpose and Generation </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Purpose: Provide statistical characteristics of a given set of data. </p>
<p>➢Box plot can be either horizontal or vertical </p>
<p>➢MATLAB function, <em>boxplot</em>, can be used to generate box plot from a given set of experimental data. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Four Key Rules of Selecting Appropriate Graph</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>a)  Use line graph for dynamic comparison. </li>
<li>b)  Use scatter plot to find a correlation for a collection of data. </li>
<li>c)  Use bar graphs when findings can be subdivided and compared. </li>
<li>d)  Use pie chart to compare the parts of a whole.</li>
</ol>
<p>Table: When and How to Produce? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Purpose of the tables:<br>    ➢Present the facts more concisely by enabling side-by-side comparison. </p>
<p>➢Repetition of same data in the figures, tables, and text should be avoided. </p>
<p>➢Professional table can be produced by using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft word. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Placement of Contents in a Table </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Place the most familiar item on the left side, and new information on the right side. </p>
<p>➢Organize the contents in a logical manner. ➢Listings and numbers in a table should be aligned. </p>
<p>➢Similar components (such as, hours in day) are preferred to be arranged vertically. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to Deal with Large Tables? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢Oversized table should be avoided; however, sometimes they are inevitable. </p>
<ol>
<li>a)  Try to reduce the number of unnecessary columns. </li>
<li>b)  Try to breakdown a large table into two or multiple small tables.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Guideline for an Algorithm </p>
<blockquote>
<p>➢What is an algorithm? </p>
<p>​	➢An algorithm is a sequence of well-defined and finite instructions required to complete a specific task. </p>
<p>➢It is visually much easier to comprehend if the algorithm is written in the form of a pseudocode. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Structure of a Pseudocode</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li><p>a)  Title. </p>
</li>
<li><p>b)  Input variables. </p>
</li>
<li><p>c)  Initialization of the required parameters. </p>
</li>
<li><p>d)  List of the control operations with the help of </p>
<p><strong>repeat, for, while, if&#x2F;else.</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Title is normally a phrase, which should not be overly long. </li>
<li>A complete sentence with active verb is not a good title. </li>
<li>Try to populate your title using the keywords. </li>
<li>Unless universally known abbreviation (e.g. DNA, AIDS, UFO) or chemical compound, avoid abbreviation in a title. </li>
<li>In general, avoid title with question, unless when there is no simple answer can be provided. </li>
<li>Avoid word such as &#96;&#96;Novel” in the title.</li>

<p><strong>Final check on your title</strong> – <strong>Answer the following question:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Would someone interested in the exact topic of your paper, reading this title, be inclined to read the abstract?</strong>  </p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>When to write the introduction? </p>
<ul>
<li>In practice, you will find that you need to be certain about what you have done and what you have found in order to write the Introduction, and so the best time to write it will be after you have written, or at least drafted, the report sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two language areas which are important in the Introduction: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tense pairs</li>
<li>Passive&#x2F;Active</li>
</ul>
<p>Passive&#x2F;Active (we have discussed before) </p>
<ul>
<li>Use Active voice when it refers to your <strong>own</strong> thoughts&#x2F;assumption&#x2F;… </li>
<li>Use Passive voice to achieve cohesion&#x2F;coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>一般我们在Introduction引用各种参考文献，有个很好的方法来分辨引用是否生硬，那就是把引用叉掉，句子还读的通，句子之间仍然有连贯性，那么这样的Introduction就写的很好，作者就是在说故事</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Polylactide (PLA) has received much attention in recent years due to its biodegradable properties, which offer important economic benefits. <strong>2</strong> PLA is a polymer obtained from corn and is produced by the polymerisation of lactide. <strong>3</strong> It has many possible uses in the biomedical field [1] and has also been investigated as a potential engineering material [2], [3]. <strong>4</strong> However, it has been found to be too weak under impact to be used commercially [4]. </p>
<p><strong>5</strong> One way to toughen polymers is to incorporate a layer of rubber particles [5] and there has been extensive research regarding the rubber modification of PLA. <strong>6</strong> For example, Penney <em>et al.</em> showed that PLA composites could be prepared using blending techniques [6] and more recently, Hillier established the toughness of such composites [7]. <strong>7</strong> However, although the effect of the rubber particles on the mechanical properties of copolymer systems was demonstrated over two years ago [8], little attention has been paid to the selection of an appropriate rubber component. </p>
<p><strong>8</strong> The present paper presents a set of criteria for selecting such a component. On the basis of these criteria it then describes the preparation of a set of polymer blends using PLA and a hydro-carbon rubber(PI)<em>.</em> <strong>10</strong> Th is combination of two mechanistically distinct polymerisations formed a novel copolymer in which the incorporation of PI significantly increased flexibility*.* </p>
<p><strong>Analyze</strong>:</p>
<p><u>Begin the introduction</u> </p>
<ul>
<li>Most research articles begin by indicating that the research field or topic is useful or significant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sentence 1</p>
<p>“<em>Polylactide (PLA) has received much attention in recent years due to its biodegradable properties, which offer important economic benefits</em>.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer establishes the importance of this research topic. </p>
<p>刚开始不要写的很深奥，要slow</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Begin the introduction</u> </p>
<ul>
<li>Research articles often begin with accepted or established facts. This ensures that the reader shares the same level of background information as the writer, and is therefore ready to read the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sentence 2 </p>
<p>‘<em>PLA is a polymer obtained from corn and is produced by the polymerisation of lactide</em>.’ </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer provides general background information for the reader. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Begin the introduction</u> </p>
<ul>
<li>Significance and Background</li>
</ul>
<p>Sentence 3 </p>
<p>‘*PLA has many possible uses in the biomedical field [1] and has also been investigated as a potential engineering material [2], [3].*’ </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer does the same as in Sentences 1 and 2, but in a more specific&#x2F;detailed way, using research references to support both the background facts and the claim for significance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>General problem area</u> </p>
<p>Sentence 4 </p>
<p><em>“However, it has been found to be too weak under impact to be used</em> *commercially [4].*” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer describes the general problem area or the current research focus of the field. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Remember to keep this general description of the problem area or current research focus brief.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Transition between the general problem area and the literature review</u> </p>
<p>Sentence 5 </p>
<p>“*One way to toughen polymers is to incorporate a layer of rubber particles.*” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer provides a transition between the general problem area and the literature review. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Literature review</u> </p>
<p>Sentence 6 </p>
<p>“*For example, Penney et al. showed that PLA composites could be prepared using blending techniques [6] and more recently, Hillier [7] established the toughness of such composites.*” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer provides a brief overview of key research projects in this area. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As a general rule, you should include references to previous or current research wherever it is useful, even in a sentence whose function is primarily to provide a transition. </li>
<li>You can’t just ‘pour’ the literature review onto the page in any order; </li>
<li>You should arrange your references and studies so that the reader is able to process them in a logical way.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Introduce your research purpose Sentence 7</u> </p>
<p>“*However, although the effect of the rubber particles on the mechanical properties of copolymer systems was demonstrated over two years ago [8], little attention has been paid to the selection of an appropriate rubber component.*” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer describes a gap in the research. </p>
<p>This is where you begin to introduce the purpose of your paper and the specific problem you will deal with, and in order to do this </p>
<p>it is necessary to create a research space. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Introduce your research purpose</u> </p>
<p>It is conventional to introduce your research purpose with a signaling connector such as However or Although*.* Don’t be shy about pointing out the problems in previous research. </p>
<ol>
<li>It may be necessary in order to explain why you have done your study. </li>
<li>The language used here is usually respectful and impersonal and is therefore not considered offensive.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Introduce your research purpose</u> </p>
<p>Sentence 8</p>
<p>“*The present paper presents a set of criteria for selecting such a component.*” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer describes the paper itself. </p>
<p>You can describe it, say what its purpose or focus is, give its structure or a combination of these. You normally use the Present Simple tense to describe the work itself (This paper is organized as follows… or This study focuses on…) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Give the methodology and finding of your paper</u> </p>
<p>Sentence 9 </p>
<p>“*On the basis of these criteria it then describes the preparation of a set of polymer blends using PLA and a hydrocarbon rubber(PI).*” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer gives details about the methodology reported in the paper. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sentence 10 </p>
<p>‘<em>This combination of two mechanistically distinct polymerisations formed a novel copolymer in which the incorporation of PI significantly increased flexibility</em>.’ </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer announces the findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Give the methodology and finding of your paper</u> </p>
<p>Although you can give information about your methodology or findings in the Introduction, be careful not to go into too much detail at this point or you will find that you have nothing to write about in the Methodology or Results sections. </p>

<ul>
<li>One of the most important reasons for writing a Results Section is that you must communicate your own understanding and interpretation of the results to your readers. </li>
<li>We need numerical results to validate analysis, verify our experiments, demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed algorithm, compare the proposed scheme with other existing schemes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Build the model for numerical results</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can begin the numerical results by describing the scenarios of your numerical experiments and re-emphasize the system model assumptions. </p>
</li>
<li><p>You must specify your parameters of your simulations&#x2F;experiments clearly and precisely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>compare your results with other research (in various conditions)</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to describe individual results in some detail, selecting results which are important, typical, or especially interesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Discuss problems found in the results. Don’t ignore problems in your results unless you are certain that the problems are insignificant and invisible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Including a discussion of a problem in your work shows that you are <strong>fully in control of your research</strong> and able to evaluate it clearly. Furthermore, it provides you with an essential element for the Discussion&#x2F;Conclusion: directions or suggestions for <strong>future research</strong>.</li>

<p>How to assess a manuscript and write a review report? </p>
<p><u>以下是Prof. Cheng自己做审稿人的经验，知己知彼:P</u></p>
<p><strong>Peer review is about striving towards the TRUTH – the very quest of scientific enquiry!</strong></p>
<p>Paper versus Manuscript</p>
<ul>
<li>before publishment is manuscript</li>
<li>after publishment is paper</li>
</ul>
<p>Peer reviews can benefit your own career!  Here are the benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaining first-hand experience of the key considerations that go into the publication decision</li>
<li>Keeping up to date with novel research in your field</li>
<li>Having an opportunity to demonstrate your expertise</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of peer review</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-blind peer review 单盲，作者不知道审稿人，审稿人知道作者</li>
<li>Double-blind peer review 双盲，双方都不知道对方是谁，比如IEEE Communication Letter</li>
<li>Open peer review 公开，谁都可以comment，审稿人可酌情考虑public opinion，这种要求很高</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you begin </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do I have the appropriate expertise to review this manuscript? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Do I have any conflict of interest regarding this article or its author? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Do I have the time to conduct this review effectively?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Managing your review </p>
<ul>
<li>Treat the materials you receive as confidential documents • Criticize the work, not the authors</li>
<li>Read journal guidelines carefully</li>
<li>Adapt your review to suit the journal’s requirements </li>
<li>Write clearly and precisely</li>
